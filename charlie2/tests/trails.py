Trail making

Description
===========

In this task, the proband must press the circles drawn on the screen in a specified
order, making a 'trail' between them. There are a total of six blocks to the test, with
varying numbers of trials in each block. In the first and second blocks, the proband
draws a trail between consecutive numbers, starting with 1. In the third and fourth
blocks, the proband does the same with letters starting with 'a'. In the fifth and sixth
blocks, the proband alternates between numbers and letters. Odd-numbered blocks are
'practice' blocks with 5 trials each, and even-numbered blocks are 'test' blocks with
20 trials each.

The traditional trail-making test (see [1]_ and [2]_) contains only two blocks
(equivalent to the 'number' and 'number-letter' blocks in the present version). The
traditional test is also done with pen and paper, and requires an experienced
experimenter to administer it. Thus the current version should be more convenient than
the traditional test. Please note that this test has not been verified against the
traditional version, however preliminary data from our studies suggests that they are
correlated.
