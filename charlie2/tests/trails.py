"""Trail-making test.

In this task, the proband must click on circles drawn on the screen in a
specified order, making a 'trail' between them. There are a total of six blocks
to the test, with varying numbers of trials in each block. In the first and
second blocks, the proband draws a trail between consecutive numbers, starting
with 1. In the thrid and fourth blocks, the proband does the same with letters
starting with 'a'. In the fifth and sixth blocks, the proband alternates
between numbers and letters. Odd-numbered blocks are 'practice' blocks with
5 trials each, and even-numbered blocks are 'test' blocks with 20 trials each.

The traditional trail-making test [1, 2] contains only two blocks (equivalent
to the 'number' and 'number-letter' blocks in the present version). The
traditional test is also done with pen and paper, and requires an experienced
experimenter to administer it. Thus the current version should be more
convenient than the traditional test. Please note that this test has not been
verified against the traditional version, However preliminary data from our
studies suggests that they are correlated.

Summary statistics:

    <num, let or numlet>_time_taken : time taken to complete the test block
        (seconds).
    <num, let or numlet>_blaze_errors : number of errors inside blazes.
    <num, let or numlet>_misses : number of errors outside blazes.
