"I'm going to say a letter of the alphabet. When I say begin, I want you to tell me as
many words as you can that begin with that letter. You will have 60 seconds before I
tell you to stop. None of the words can be names of people, or places, or numbers. For
example, if I gave you the letter T, you could say take, toy, tooth, and so forth, but
you should not say Tom because that is a person's name, you should not say Texas because
that is the name of a place, and you should not say twelve because that is a number.
Also, do not give me the same word with different endings. For example, if you say take,
you should not also say takes and taking. Do you have any questions?"

If during the trial the subject fails to make a response for 15 seconds, say: "Keep
going". Provide this prompt only once per trial. If the subject generates 3 consecutive
words that do not start with the designated letter, say, "The letter we are using now is 
__" Provide this prompt only once per trial.

Then say this:

"The first letter is F. Ready? Begin"
