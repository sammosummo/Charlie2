    """Digit-symbol test (practice)

At the top of the screen you will see a row of
symbols and a row of digits. Each symbol is paired
with the digit below it.

You will also see one symbol and one digit in the
middle of the screen. Your task is to decide
whether they make a correct pair. Respond 'Yes' if
they do, and 'No' if they don't. Press any key to
try some practice trials.

Touch the squares to begin.""",

    """Digit-symbol test, part 2 (real test)

Now you will perform the real test. It is the same
as the practice, except there are more trials,
and there is no feedback. Try to complete the task
as quickly as you can within 180 seconds, without
making mistakes.""",
