On each trial you will see a picture with a piece missing
from it. Your task is to touch the missing piece from the
five alternatives that appear at the bottom of the screen.
There is only one correct choice per picture. If you think
that more than one answer is correct, touch the one you
think fits best.

This test uses the touchscreen.
